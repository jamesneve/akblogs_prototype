== Demonstration App

This is an example feed aggregator app for AKB48 member blogs. Feel free to browse the code.
It's mostly intended as a proof-of-concept, so various aspects such as caching and scaling are missing.
A more sophisticated version is currently in development in a private repo.
An example of this app is running on http://akblogs.herokuapp.com
Excuse the incredible amount of pink ^^;
